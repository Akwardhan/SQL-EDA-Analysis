#  SQL EDA Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using SQL on a layoff dataset from global companies. The data was cleaned in a previous project, and this analysis focuses on uncovering insights, trends, and patterns related to layoffs across different countries and years.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** 
- **SQL** (CTEs, Aggregation, Ranking, and more)

## Language
- **SQL**

## Dataset
The dataset contains 2000+ layoff records from various global companies, with data points like company name, country, total laid off, and percentage laid off. It was cleaned and preprocessed in the previous project.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand layoff trends.
- Summarize layoffs by country and year.
- Calculate rolling totals and ranks of layoffs.
- Visualize key insights from the dataset.

## Key Steps

### 1. Cleaned Data Overview
The project uses a cleaned dataset from a previous data cleaning phase, where duplicates were removed, and the data was standardized.

### 2. Total Laid Off by Country and Year
Aggregated the total number of people laid off by country and year to analyze country-specific trends.

### 3. Percentage of Laid Off by Company
Analyzed the percentage of layoffs by company to understand how individual companies were impacted.

### 4. Rolling Total of Laid-Off Employees
Calculated the rolling total of layoffs to understand how layoffs accumulated over time.

### 5. Companies with the Most Layoffs in a Year
Identified the company that laid off the most employees in a given year, highlighting major workforce reductions.

## SQL Script
The complete SQL queries used in the analysis can be found in [EDA_Script.sql](https://github.com/Akwardhan/SQL-EDA-Analysis/blob/main/SQL-EDA/EDA-SQL-PROJECT-LAYOFFS.sql)

## Learnings
- Enhanced skills in SQL for performing EDA on large datasets.
- Gained experience using advanced SQL functions like CTEs, Ranking, Aggregations, and more
- Developed a deep understanding of how layoffs impact companies and industries across different countries.
